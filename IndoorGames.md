# SCVC Indoor Volleyball Games

Want to play volleyball with players at your level?  
Want to play volleyball for the whole time you signed up?  
Join our SCVC (Seattle Chinese Volleyball Club) indoor volleyball games!  

SCVC is a non-profit organization, organizing multiple levels of indoor volleyball games. Games on each level require a corresponding permit to sign up to ensure players meet the corresponding skill requirement. All games will have a 12 person capacity so that everyone gets to play the whole time.

Currently we provide BB, B+, B level games and practice sessions. BB and B+ level are for competitive game play while BB is more intensive. B level is for recreational game play. C level is for new players with basic skills. Practice sessions are for players to improve basic and advanced skills.

To get a permit of your skill level, please sign up for one of our practice sessions, where we will estimate your skill level. If your estimated skill level is B or above, we will invite you to one of our corresponding level games for free, and grant you a permit based on your performance in the game. Otherwise, you can attend our practice sessions to gain basic skills. To sign up for our practice session, please login to our [signup website](https://joingame.azurewebsites.net/) with a Google account.

If you’re confident about your volleyball skill, instead of signing up for a practice session, you could also [email us](mailto:contact@scvc.ngo) your experience in playing volleyball so that we could try to arrange you to join one of our games for free. To help us better understand your volleyball skill, you could include your experience in detail, e.g. how long you’ve been playing volleyball for, links/videos of volleyball leagues/open gyms you’ve been joining, positions you usually play, etc.
